# Clubmaster

This repository is a fork of the original clubmaster by Aine Caoimhe, it does not contain the animations shipped, just the lsl and notecards.

Notecards have two extensions in this repository. 
.xml is for XMLS style notecards - but should still be copy/pasted as notecards inworld
.txt is for a text style notecard - just a notecard inworld
